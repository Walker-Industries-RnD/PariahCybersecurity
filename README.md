## What is Pariah Cybersecurity?

Pariah Cybersecurity is a .NET 8.0 Based Library. Primarily developed for programs like the XRUIOS, Project Replicant and Database Designer, it contains a suite of tools meant to make development both easy and secure for developers of all levels!

This is fully open source and free forever! It was made to target Windows, Linux and MacOS!

(Note, there are many comments all around; you'll see as time continued they decreased in quality and quantity. I plan on adding more comments again at a later time, but I currently have other projects I would like to focus on! Everything should be fine to use in production!)

## How Do I Use It?

Let's say you have some data you want to save, like

```csharp
var YareliGallery = List<Custom.ImageObj>`
```

With Pariah Cybersecurity, all you have to do is

``` csharp
//Create a new Pariah Object on Disc
await JSONDataHandler.CreateJsonFile(pathToSaveTo, "Yareli Gallery", new JObject {} );
//Load the PariahJSON you just made
var loadedGalleryFile = await JSONDataHandler.LoadJsonFile(pathToSaveTo, "Yareli Gallery");
//Add the gallery list to the PariahJson
var savedGallery = await JSONDataHandler.AddToJson<List<Custom.ImageObj>>(loadedGalleryFile, "Gallery", YareliGallery, Password);
//Save the PariahJSON
await JSONDataHandler.SaveJson(savedGallery);
```

Now, whenever you want to get your variable, all you need to do is use

```csharp
//Load the PariahJson from disc
var loadedGalleryFile = await JSONDataHandler.LoadJsonFile(pathToSaveTo, "Yareli Gallery");
//Get the GalleryFile value
var loadedGallery = await JSONDataHandler.GetVariable<List<Custom.ImageObj>>(loadedGalleryFile, "Gallery", Password);
```

Keep in mind; there are a lot of systems within Pariah. Go to the [[Examples Directory]] and you can see specific examples for the library you'll be using!

## Prerequisites

#### The Following Are Needed To Use All Of Pariah Cybersecurity:

- BouncyCastle.NetCore

- Ceras

- k4os.Compression.LZ4

¬†- Konscious.Security.Cryptography.Argon2

- Newtonsoft.Json

- Parquet.Net

- EasyCompressor.LZ4

- Data.HashFunction.Blake3

- System.Data.HashFunction.Interfaces



## Changes, Fixes And Future Developments

- [X] Changing SecureString to use a custom char[] or byte[] based system (The current SecureString has a length limit, immediate fix needed)
- [ ] Fix Pack and Unpack File (Not too important since I can use the AESmethod for now, I might outsource help here )
- [ ] Readding one of the disabled signatures to the account with session system (Should still be secure without)
- [ ] Package Dependencies Into Singular DLL
- [ ] Adding more graceful error handling (Ha, like that's happening)
- [ ] Releasing Pariah Cybersecurity's password manager as an example
